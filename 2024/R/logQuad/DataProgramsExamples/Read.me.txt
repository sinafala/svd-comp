                     Essential R code and data to accompany 
  "A flexible two-dimensional mortality model for use in indirect estimation" 
             by Wilmoth, Zureick, Canudas-Romo, Inoue, and Sawyer


The files in this archive contain code written in R (see www.r-project.org)
for estimating the log-quadratic mortality model from a large collection of
historical data, and for applying that model in a wide variety of situations.

The archive also includes the collection of 719 abridged life tables (from the 
Human Mortality Database, www.mortality.org) used for estimating the model, 
as well as estimates of model coefficients according to the preferred method 
of fitting the model to data (the bi-weight method, as described in the paper 
and supplemental materials).

The R code is found in three separate files.  First, "functions.R" contains a
variety of functions that perform the bulk of the actual calculations.  Second,
"modeling.R" contains code used for estimating the log-quadratic model (using
the bi-weight method) by calling functions in the first file.  Third, "figures.R"
contains code for creating Figure 4 of the paper, illustrating various forms of 
the age pattern of mortality that can be produced using the fitted model.

For applying the model in various situations, the function lthat.any2.logquad() is 
especially useful.  Supplying any two of five possible input parameters - 5q0, k,
e0, 45q15, 35q15, and 1q0 - though excluding the pairing of 5q0 and 1q0 (because this
combination contains no information about adult mortality) and the pairing of 45q15
and 35q15 (because this combination contains no information about child mortality), 
the function produces an age schedule of mortality rates (in both 5- and 1-year 
age groups), as well as a full set of life table functions (5-year age groups only).
